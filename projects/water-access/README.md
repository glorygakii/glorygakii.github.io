# Access to Safe Drinking Water in Maji Ndogo: Transparency and Analytics

## Context
Safe and affordable drinking water is a pressing challenge in Maji Ndogo. This project investigated water availability, affordability, and transparency in fund allocation. The dataset contained over 60,000 records across multiple tables, requiring structured queries, clustering, and visualization to uncover meaningful insights.

## Tools Used
- **Excel**: pivot analysis, structured reporting  
- **SQL**: data extraction, transformation, relational modeling, window functions  
- **Power BI**: data modeling with DAX, dashboard design, performance optimization  

## Process
1. **Data Exploration**: Queried large datasets to understand water source distribution and affordability.  
2. **Clustering Analysis**: Applied SQL functions to classify water sources and identify crisis patterns.  
3. **Relational Modeling**: Connected multiple tables to weave a coherent narrative of water access.  
4. **Visualization**: Designed Power BI dashboards with refined visuals, custom formatting, and clear storytelling.  
5. **Transparency Tracking**: Compared budgeted versus actual costs to flag discrepancies and promote accountability.  

## Results & Insights
- Identified regions with **limited access to safe water**, highlighting affordability gaps.  
- Classified water sources into categories (safe, unsafe, affordable, unaffordable) for engineering teams.  
- Built a **public-facing dashboard** to track water funds, project completion, and team performance.  
- Promoted **transparency and accountability** by visualizing discrepancies between allocated budgets and actual spending.  

## Reflection
This project demonstrated my ability to:
- Work with **large relational datasets** using SQL.  
- Apply **clustering and statistical analysis** to uncover hidden patterns.  
- Build **interactive dashboards** that communicate insights to both technical and non-technical audiences.  
- Align technical work with **social impact**, ensuring data integrity and transparency in resource allocation.
